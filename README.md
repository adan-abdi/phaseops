# PhaseOps: The Digital Career Exoskeleton

**PhaseOps** is a modular, AI-augmented, local-first job search operating system.  
It integrates a Rust CLI, a local web UI, and an in-browser HUD to track, augment, and accelerate your job hunt.

Built after 3,200 applications. Tuned by failure. Hardened for war.

## 🧬 Operational Channels

| Channel           | Role                                          | Target UX                |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **CLI**           | Power-user control & automation               | Terminal-based operators |
| **Web Portal**    | Local UI for resume gen, logging, dashboard   | Visual-first users       |
| **Browser HUD**   | Overlay inside LinkedIn Jobs (Tauri/Extension)| Real-time field ops      |

All channels operate on shared local data, version-controlled resume templates, and LLM-assisted job targeting.
